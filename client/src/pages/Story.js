      <p>Fall 2020. The world is still dealing with the effects of COVID-19. </p>
      <p>As a coding bootcamp graduate seeking a job, I was trying the guerilla tactic of sending out as many applications as I could and hoping that somehow, someone would be interested. It didn't work, and as time wore on, I began to wonder if I'd ever find a job.</p>

      <p>I ended up signing on with a mentor on how to get a job. It ended up being very beneficial, and gave me the confidence I needed to believe that I could have a career as a software developer.</p>

      <p>One day, when thinking about how to "freshen up" an old project, I thought about the stories I kept hearing on sites like LinkedIn and Reddit:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>People who lost their jobs</li>
        <li>College grads and junior developers lamenting how they now had to compete with overqualified candidates</li>
        <li>Stories about rejections and ghostings</li>
        <li>People wondering if they'd ever be able to make it in the software industry</li>
      </ul>

      <p>I realized that there were a lot of discouraged people out there, and I wanted to help them out, thus this app was born.</p>

      <p>I'd like to say it was a nice and easy process - but that would be completely wrong. I ended up having to rewrite the whole thing multiple times - mainly due to how I was trying to slap ideas from different tutorials together - but eventually it all came together into what you are seeing now.</p>

      <p>If there's one thing I want you to take from this, it's that I want to, well, encourage you. I don't want to end up being overly mushy, so to speak, but I do want you to use this to find the courage to take on whatever challenges may come your way.</p>
